# Employee Polls

This is my final project for udacity react course.
The goal of this project is create an employee polls web app, where employee can create polls, cast their votes and compete with others on leaderboard.

## Getting started

To get started, you need to install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en).
Then, clone this repository, change directory and run the command below to install necessary packages.

After everything is installed, you can run the app using this command:

The app will automatically open browser on port `5173`. If it wouldn't, you might need to go to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) manually.
